Hello guys!

I decided to create a new blog with a tool other than <a href="https://alejandroroa.now.sh/" target="_blank">my old website</a>

The technology I am using is <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> and I was inclined to use it because of the great flexibility and speed with which I can set up a blog, then, this leads me to learn much more of the tool and with that experience provide this service to other people.

My old website is very nice at UI level, but, it is not versatile: The technologies I use are Handlebars and Express.js, I created this project under the idea of a static site (that is to say, I use express only for rendering, all it shows is simple html, no Apis). Although the result was good and served me well at the time every time I made a post I had to be careful with the layout on each page to not
damage anything and that it looked different at some point. With Gatsby this does not happen, you simply write a .md file following the structure of a skeleton example that has this system and that's it, you have a new post.

In addition, I want to take advantage of features to apply SEO, greater speed and easy customization to my site and in time, with work, be more accessible as a professional in search engines.

It is worth noting that for a while I also published in <a href="https://alejandroroa.medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> but as a good developer I always wanted to create my own tool or have a little more control over it.

Static sites, blogs, SEO, and even monetization are worlds I don't know very well but I hope to learn progressively, I already started the path.

Greetings!
